## üß† React + Fabric.js Image Editor - Developer Documentation

### 1. üìå Project Overview

This project is a **web-based graphical editor** built with **React** and **Vite**, designed for creating and manipulating images and vector graphics directly in the browser. It uses **Fabric.js** for powerful canvas rendering and drawing capabilities and **FontAwesome** for modern UI icons. The app features an interactive canvas where users can draw, add shapes, images, and apply filters. Optimized with **hot module replacement** and **ESLint** for faster development and cleaner code, this project serves as a strong foundation for browser-based image editing or annotation tools.

### 4. üß© Open Source Libraries Used & Customization

- **Fabric.js**: Used for creating a dynamic canvas; supports drawing, shape rendering, filters. Brush size and color are configurable. Fabric filters are applied through UI.
- **FontAwesome**: Integrated with `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome` for UI icons.
- **React**: Main frontend library to build component-based UI.
- **Vite**: Ultra-fast dev server and build tool used in place of Create React App.
- **ESLint**: Integrated for code quality and standardization.
- **Customization Highlights**:
  - Configured `PencilBrush` from Fabric.js.
  - Filters and object interactions handled via React state and event listeners.
  - Clean, responsive toolbox UI built using modern layout techniques.

### 5. ‚è±Ô∏è Task Estimation

- **Estimated time for a trainee or beginner (without AI):** 5 working days
  This includes project setup, learning Fabric.js, integrating drawing tools and filters, and building a responsive UI.
- **Estimated time with AI tools (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude):** 2 working days
  AI support can significantly speed up integration, component logic, Fabric API exploration, and UI development.

### 6. üß† Potential AI Hallucinations / Debugging Notes

| Area                        | Possible Issue                                                           | Debugging Tip                                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Fabric.js Brush/Canvas APIs | Copilot may suggest incorrect instantiation of `Canvas` or outdated APIs | Refer to the [Fabric.js Docs](http://fabricjs.com/docs/) for the correct class usage |
| React-Fabric Integration    | AI may assume state is reactive by default; Fabric canvas is imperative  | Use refs and side effects (e.g., `useEffect`) carefully for syncing                  |
| Filter Application          | AI might hallucinate filter chaining logic or unsupported filter types   | Always check the full list of supported Fabric filters                               |
| Image Upload                | AI might suggest `FileReader` usage without handling onload properly     | Ensure image is loaded before adding it to canvas; wrap in async/await               |
| Vite Config                 | AI may suggest webpack-specific setup                                    | Stick to Vite-compatible configuration patterns only                                 |
